# Movie clips of high and low social interactions
This repo includes two movie clips professionally filmed with the same crew (four players) to show either high- or low-level verbal and non-verbal social interactions. The movie’s theme was people playing basketball in an outdoor court, and the scenes in the two movie clips matched with each other. The duration of each film was 5 min 5 s.
