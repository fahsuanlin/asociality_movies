# Movie clips of high and low social interactions
This repo includes two movie clips professionally filmed with the same crew (four players) to show either high- or low-level verbal and non-verbal social interactions. The movieâ€™s theme was people playing basketball in an outdoor court, and the scenes in the two movie clips matched with each other. The duration of each film was 5 min 5 s.
